# Projects

These are my projects accomplished over time.


## Blog App
  This is my first project implemented in C++ and it is designed to function as a simple blog system through a command-line interface. In App1.exe users can perform actions such as viewing existing articles with their details, posting new articles and deleting them. The system also suppoerts commenting on articles, with interactions (likes, loves, dislikes) through the second app, App2.exe.
  The data is stored in text files, offering a basic yet functional blog platform through a command-line interface.


## Reantal Property System
  This JavaFX application serves as a Rental Property System with three user roles: Guest, User, and Admin. The system incorporates a MySQL database for storing application data. Key features for each role are as follows:
  *Guest Mode
  Capabilities:  View both available and unavailable properties, apply filters for property selection.
  Restrictions: Cannot rent properties or access lease information.

  *User Mode
  Capabilities: Signup or login to use the system efficiently, rent properties and access lease information for rented properties.
  Features: View only available properties, apply filters.

  *Admin Mode
  Capabilities: Login with specific credentials, view all lease information, and add new properties to the system.
