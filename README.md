# Projects

These are my projects accomplished over time.

## Blog App
  This is my first project implemented in `C++` and it is designed to function as a simple blog system through a command-line interface. In _**App1.exe**_ users can perform actions such as viewing existing articles with their details, posting new articles and deleting them. The system also supports commenting on articles, with interactions (likes, loves, dislikes) through the second app, _**App2.exe**_.
  The data is stored in text files, offering a basic yet functional blog platform through a command-line interface.
